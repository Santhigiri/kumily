"""
Application configuration read from the environment.

A single ``settings`` singleton is exported and imported directly wherever
configuration is needed. Values are read from environment variables (and an
optional ``.env`` file, already gitignored), so secrets never live in the
repository.

Kumily is a JWT resource server, not an identity provider: it never mints
tokens or stores credentials. It only verifies access tokens minted by TVM
(the Ashram's auth microservice) against TVM's published JWKS — the same
verification chandiroor performs, since both services trust the same TVM
instance.
