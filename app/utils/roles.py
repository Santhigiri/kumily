"""
User roles for authorization.

``Role`` is a string enum so it serialises naturally in JSON responses. Member
*names* (not values) must match TVM's role claim exactly — TVM signs its
access tokens with a Kotlin enum whose ``.name`` is one of ``USER``,
``EDITOR``, ``ADMIN``, ``SUPER_ADMIN``, ``ROOT`` — since ``core.security``
resolves an incoming claim via ``Role[claim_value]``. ``ANONYMOUS`` is
Kumily's own concept for "no token presented" and is never a claim TVM
issues.

The six roles form an ordered privilege hierarchy used by the
``require_role`` dependency to gate endpoints at a minimum level. Mirrors
``chandiroor``'s ``app/utils/roles.py`` exactly — both services verify
tokens minted by the same TVM instance.
